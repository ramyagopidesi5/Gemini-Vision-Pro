Pioneering the Future of Chemical Science with Gemini Vision Pro

### OBJECTIVE:
The goal of this project is to create a Health Management application that leverages AI to analyze uploaded images of tablets and provide detailed information about their uses and characteristics. The application integrates the Google Gemini API for image analysis and generates insights for pharmaceutical or chemist-related tasks. The app enables users to upload images of tablets, receive textual descriptions of their uses, and optionally provide additional context for better responses.

### FEATURES:
1.	Image Upload: Users can upload images of tablets in various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, JPEG).
2.	AI-based Analysis: The application uses Google’s Gemini API (version gemini-1.5-flash, after deprecation of gemini-pro-vision) to analyze the image and generate textual information about the tablet(s) shown.
3.	Customizable Prompts: Users can optionally add custom prompts to refine the responses generated by the AI.
4.	Image Display: The uploaded image is displayed on the user interface for easy reference.




### APP FLOW:
1.	User Uploads Image: The user selects an image file of a tablet (e.g., jpg, jpeg, png).
2.	Textual Input: The user can enter an additional prompt to supplement the default analysis request.
3.	AI Response Generation: Once the user submits the image and optional prompt, the app calls the Gemini API to analyze the image and provide a detailed description of the tablet(s).
4.	Results Display: The AI's response is displayed on the Streamlit interface, providing insights on the tablets, such as their uses, features, and specifications.


### TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1.	Python: The app is developed in Python using Streamlit for the user interface.
2.	Streamlit: A lightweight framework used to create interactive web applications.
3.	Google Gemini API: Utilized for image analysis, particularly for extracting details from images of tablets.
4.	Pillow (PIL): Used to handle image operations such as reading and displaying images.
5.	dotenv: Loads environment variables (such as API keys) from a .env file for security.
6.	PIP Libraries: Required libraries include google-generativeai, streamlit, PIL, and dotenv.




### KEY CODE COMPONENTS:
1.	Environment Setup:
▪	The API key is loaded from a .env file using the dotenv library. This keeps sensitive information secure.
            CODE
from dotenv import load_dotenv
            load_dotenv()
      2.   Image Upload and Processing:
●	The input_image_setup function processes the uploaded image, converting it into the format expected by the Gemini API.
            CODE:
            def input_image_setup(uploaded_file):
    		if uploaded_file is not None:
        			image = Image.open(uploaded_file)
        			image_data = {
            				"mime_type": uploaded_file.type,  # Example: "image/jpeg"
            				"data": uploaded_file.getvalue(),  # Raw bytes of the image
       			 }
       			return image_data
    		else:
       			raise FileNotFoundError("No file uploaded")


       3.   AI Response Generation:
●	The get_gemini_response function interacts with the Gemini API, passing the image data and prompt for analysis.
       CODE:
       def get_gemini_response(input_image, prompt):
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')  # Updated to use gemini-1.5-flash
    response = model.generate_content([input_image, prompt])
    return response.text
    4.   User Interface:
●	Streamlit handles the user interface with an image uploader, text input for additional prompts, and a button to trigger the AI analysis.
        CODE:
        	st.set_page_config(page_title="AI Chemist App")
st.header("AI Chemist App")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose an image...", type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"])
submit = st.button("Tell me")

### CHALLENGES FACED:
1.	API Deprecation:
▪	Initially, the app used the gemini-pro-vision model, but this model was deprecated as of July 2024. The app was updated to use the gemini-1.5-flash model, which required adjustments to input formats and a change in the method for interacting with the API.
2.	Input Format:
▪	The app needed to handle the image data in the correct format for the API. Initially, raw image bytes were used, but after the update to the new model, further refinement was necessary to ensure compatibility with the Gemini API.
3.	Error Handling:
▪	Proper error handling was necessary for cases where no image was uploaded, or the response from the AI could not be generated due to API issues.

### CONCLUSION:
The AI Chemist App is a functional tool for health management, enabling users to upload images of tablets and receive AI-generated descriptions based on the visual analysis of the tablet(s). By leveraging Google’s Gemini API, the app is capable of identifying tablets and providing detailed descriptions related to their uses, features, and specifications.
The development of this app demonstrates the potential of generative AI in healthcare and pharmaceutical applications, particularly in automating the process of identifying and categorizing tablets from images.
